### **Assignment**

1. Review [Part 4 on Grid Properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-properties) from CSS-Tricks.
2. Go back to our [CSS exercises repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) (you've done these previously, but don't forget that the instructions are in the README). Do the exercises in the 'grid' directory in the following order:
* `grid-layout-2`
* `grid-layout-3`

Note: When doing these exercises, please use all the documentation and resources you need to accomplish them. You are *not* intended to have any of this stuff memorized at this point. Check the docs, use google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.
